The traditional vocal and instrumental music of Georgia (*Sakartvelo*)
employs a tuning system or systems (scales, pitch sets) 
that are emphatically different from Western ideas of scale and tuning.
Stuart Gelzer and others have proposed that
the Georgian "scale" can be characterized as an equal division
of the perfect fifth into four "whole steps", much as the modern
Western chromatic scale can be characterized as an equal division of
the octave into twelve "half steps".

Knowledge of Georgian music has been transmitted orally for
centuries and for the most part has not been written down
until recently, and then only through awkward and misleading
mapping to Western musical notation that treats the ancient
system essentially as a detuning of the Western whole tone scale.

Gelzer has been working on an approach to notating Georgian 
music that is free of such bias but close enough to 
Western notation to lower the barrier to entry for those 
familiar with the latter who wish to perform and study the former, 
yet still suitable for archival and musicological purposes.
