% panduri-common.ly - common settings for scores that 
%                     use staff contexts with the 
%                     Panduri clef
%
% Defines Panduri clef and related settings for scores
% using that clef.
%
% Also defines \gamutStaff, which produces a line with 
% labeled notes within the gamut of the Panduri clef, 
% including tuning "hints".
%
% If the variable showGamut is true, produces the
% gamut staff. If variable unbarred is true, omits
% time signature, bar lines, and bar numbers.
%
% Requires unbarred, showGamut, gamutMusic, gamutText, 
% and middleCPosition to be defined. 
%
% If header property "engraved" is defined, it will
% be used in the tagline.
%
\version "2.19.15"

% Takes two arguments, the alignment amount (#LEFT = -1,
% #RIGHT = 1) and the markup text for the mark.
